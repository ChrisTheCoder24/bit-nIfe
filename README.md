Hello, this is a multi tool for hacking. There is a warning message for our commands that are illegal to use without the target's permission.
Included in the tool is a vulerability scanner, port scanner, domain to ip and the oppsite, all the saved WIFIs on your computer and their passwords, 
OS, systeminfo, your ip (including your public ip), this tool also supports access to other tools (most of them need to be installed), traceroute, sql injection,
scan a WIFI, geolocate, and much more! And if you have good anti virus you will need to disable to be able to install bit-nIfe multi tool because it is a
